# 🧠 Schedule Recommender - Backend (Google ADK)

This repository implements a multi-agent system using **Google's Agent Development Kit (ADK)** to assist students with academic course scheduling. It forms the backend layer of the DSF project under the Fellowship 2025.

---

## 🚀 Features

- 🤖 **Modular Agent Architecture**  
  Built using Google ADK for a clean, extensible agent-based system.

- 🧭 **Intent-Based Routing**  
  A root agent intelligently routes user requests to the appropriate sub-agent based on intent.

- 📚 **Scheduler Agent**  
  Handles scheduling-related queries by interacting with mock databases (courses, offerings, students), and includes tools like `get_enrollable_courses`, `get_course_details`, and `build_schedule`.

- 💬 **Talkative Agent**  
  Manages casual, off-topic, and ethical conversations, ensuring user engagement stays human-like and safe.

- 📦 **Easily Extensible**  
  Simple to add new tools or agents with minimal changes, enabling fast iteration.

- 📜 **Instruction-Based Behavior + Logging**  
  Agent behavior is driven by instruction files, with clean and contextual logging to aid debugging and traceability.

## 🧠 Agents Overview

This project uses a modular, agent-based architecture powered by Google ADK. Below is a high-level summary of each agent's role.

➡️ For implementation details, see the [Agents Documentation](./agents/).

---

### 🔸 `coordinator` (Root Agent)

- Acts as the top-level router for all user queries
- Parses intent and forwards requests to the appropriate sub-agent
- Does **not** respond directly
- Sets up student context via a `before_agent_callback` to mock end-user

### 🔹 `scheduler`

- Handles scheduling-related tasks like course recommendations, offerings lookup, and mock schedule creation
- Operates on mock academic data for students, courses, and offerings

### 🔹 `talkative`

- Manages social, casual, off-topic, or unethical queries
- Instruction-only agent with no backend or tool access

## 🛠️ Setup Instructions

This project uses [`uv`](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv) — a fast Python package manager and environment manager.

Follow these steps to get started:

---

### 1. **Install `uv`**

```bash
pip install uv
```

---

### 2. **Clone the repo**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Shikhar16078/dsf_backend_adk.git
cd dsf_backend_adk
```

---

### 3. **Install all dependencies from `pyproject.toml`**

```bash
uv venv                          # Create a virtual environment
source .venv/bin/activate        # On Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate
uv pip install -r pyproject.toml  # ✅ Install dependencies from pyproject.toml
```

✅ The above `uv` commands will:

- Automatically create a `.venv/` if not already present
- Activate it
- Install all dependencies lightning-fast using `pyproject.toml`

---

### 4. **Set up `.env` file**

Create a `.env` file in the project root:

```bash
touch .env
```

Then paste the following starter content into it:

```env
GOOGLE_GENAI_USE_VERTEXAI=FALSE
GOOGLE_API_KEY=your_gemini_key
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_open_ai_key
```

Make sure to replace the placeholder keys with your actual API credentials.

### 5. **Run the local agent**

```bash
adk web agents
```

---

📦 That's it! You're now running the backend agent environment with `uv` and ADK.

📝 **Optional: To add or update dependencies**, use:

```bash
uv add <package-name>
```

This will also update the `pyproject.toml` if applicable.

## 🧪 Development Notes

- Use `.env` to configure API keys (e.g., for Gemini or ADK)
- Logging outputs to `logs/agent-<timestamp>.log`
- Add sub-agents under `agents/<agent_name>/`
- Add tools under `tools/` and register in `agent.py`
