## Style Guidelines:

- Background color: Almost-white background (#F5F3FF) for a clean, distraction-free interface.
- Accent color: Bright blue (#7DD3FC) to highlight key interactive elements, such as selected dates and buttons.
- Body and headline font: 'Inter', a grotesque-style sans-serif known for its modern, neutral look, to ensure readability and a professional feel.
- Divide the screen into two main sections: a larger area (2/3) for the calendar on the left and a smaller area (1/3) for the chatbot on the right. Maintain a clean and organized layout.
- Use simple, clear icons for calendar events and chatbot actions to aid quick recognition and interaction.
- Implement smooth transitions for calendar updates and chatbot message displays to enhance user experience.
