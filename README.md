# ðŸ“… Schedule Recommender

The **Schedule Recommender** is an AI-powered course scheduling system that helps students create personalized, conflict-free class schedules.  
It combines a conversational chatbot interface with a dynamic calendar view to make academic planning simple and interactive.  

The project is composed of two main parts:

- **Backend** â€” A multi-agent AI system built with Googleâ€™s Agent Development Kit (ADK) that interprets requests, retrieves course information, and generates valid schedules.
